(1) The top of the class here is "Interpreter.java."

(2) The logical operators are in the "logicalqueryplan" package.
    The physical operators are in the "cs4321.operator" package.
    Also, the "PhysicalPlanBuilder.java" is the class you want.

(3) I test my program on windows. The file seperaters appears in:
    a. the main() method in "Interpreter.java."
    b. the String variables in "Catalog.java."
    c. the last line in the "Parser.java."
